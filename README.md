# Portfolio

This repos hosts the source for my personal portfolio website, written with typescript and react 

## Why?

The main idea i had behind creating a simple portfolio was to develop a basic understanding of react, but also to have a simple project to practice and experiment with, setting up github actions CI/CD etc.
